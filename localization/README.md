## To get started:
-    Make an account on [Weblate](https://weblate.org) or sign in with your Github or Gitlab ID. Note: Account creation is not required, but you will only be able to suggest translations in this case

-    Visit the [AM project page](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/am) - which lists all components and their strings.

-    On the [AM project  page's 'Languages' tab](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/am/#languages) choose the language you want to work on, or -- in case the language doesn't exist yet -- initiate a new language by selecting a component from the [am component page](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/am/am/) and clicking on the "Start a new translation" button. Please note that we can't support shipping arbitrary translations with our published materials unless they have a reviewer (see below).

-    Please contact us in the AM community [discussion](https://github.com/AM-community/monorepo/discussions/2) if you are interested in becoming a reviewer for translation(s) in your language(s).
